# Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
# A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
# For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
# A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

# Example 1:
# Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
# Output: 3  
# Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
  
# Example 2:
# Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
  
# Example 3:
# Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
